## once singularity is loaded, make sure it finds the right paths for the scripts:

well you can still set up a cmssw release on cmswmass2

Josh Bendavid, [10.02.21 17:38]
you need to do 
cmssw-cc7
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh

Josh Bendavid, [10.02.21 17:39]
and then you'll have cmsenv and cmsrel and scram as normal

Josh Bendavid, [10.02.21 17:39]
but then of course you should not use that shell to run the code

Josh Bendavid, [10.02.21 17:39]
but rather the one with the singularity environment and just setting the path

Josh Bendavid, [10.02.21 17:39]
I guess we'll clean this up later so that it doesn't need the cmssw release area

Josh Bendavid, [10.02.21 17:40]
you can also just use 
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh directly if you can use a centos8 release
