p(generalTrack | standalone) is the tracking efficiency (we call it alternativeTracking), close to what POG does (but not exactly, as they do some things, like charge matching or other wonky selections)

p(tracker or global | generalTrack) is the reco (actually reco+matching) efficiency


now we changed and use

tracking: P(global | standalone)
reco: P(standalone | track-seeded track)
this requires that we use only global muons
